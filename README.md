# Turkish Cities

Generate json file for Turkish cities, districts and neighborhoods in seconds.

## How it works?

This project is using xlsx data from https://postakodu.ptt.gov.tr/ and converts
it into a json file.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- openpyxl

## How to run it?

1- Download latest xlsx data from https://postakodu.ptt.gov.tr/
2- Install python and required pip packages
2- Update filename inside run.py 
3- Execute the run.py file

If everything goes well ouput.json file should be created(or updated if you deleted the
old one) inside your folder.

## I don't care is it updated or not, how can I download the data?

If you just want to use the latest generated data, you can just use
[output.json](https://github.com/berkaycubuk/turkish-cities/blob/main/output.json)
file.
